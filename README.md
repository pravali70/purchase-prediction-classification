# 🛍️ Customer Purchase Prediction - Mini Project
👋 Welcome to this mini-project focused on predicting customer purchase behavior using machine learning!

## 📝 Project Overview
In this project, we work with a real-world dataset that includes key demographic features of customers:

Age – The customer’s age

EstimatedSalary – An estimate of the customer’s annual income

Purchased – The target variable (1 = Purchased, 0 = Not Purchased)

The goal is to develop a complete machine learning pipeline—from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing to model building and performance evaluation—to classify whether a customer is likely to make a purchase.

## 🎯 Objective
The primary objective is to build and compare the performance of multiple machine learning models to predict purchase status (Purchase or No Purchase).

This classification helps businesses:

Understand customer buying intent

Design targeted marketing campaigns

Offer personalized promotions based on predictive insights

Optimize customer engagement and sales conversions

🔍 Dataset Columns
Age: Age of the customer

EstimatedSalary: Annual salary estimate

Purchased: Target label (1 for purchase, 0 for no purchase)

## 🤖 Models Evaluated
We implemented and compared the following classification models:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Naive Bayes

Decision Tree

Random Forest

AdaBoost

XGBoost

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
To measure model effectiveness, we use the following performance metrics:

Accuracy – Overall prediction correctness

Precision – How many predicted purchases were actually correct

Recall – How many actual purchases were identified

F1 Score – Balance between precision and recall

Confusion Matrix – Matrix to visualize classification outcomes

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
This project is built in Python, using these key libraries:

pandas – Data handling and wrangling

numpy – Numerical computation

matplotlib & seaborn – Data visualization

scikit-learn – Machine learning models and evaluation metrics

xgboost – Advanced boosting algorithm for classification

## ✅ Outcome
By analyzing performance across all models, we:

Select the most accurate and robust classifier for predicting purchase behavior

Identify how Age and EstimatedSalary influence buying decisions

Provide actionable insights for marketers and sales teams to better engage with potential buyers

💡 Thanks for exploring this project! We hope it gives you practical insights into using machine learning to drive smarter customer engagement strategies.
